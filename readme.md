This project was developed by Eduardo Mendes and Nathalia Paula to accomplish the final requirements for the course of Bachelor's in Instrumentation, Automation and Robotic Engineering at University Federal of ABC, located in Santo Andr√©, Brazil.

The main objective is to develop an autonomous robot able to move in a predetermined environment, moving from point A to point B. The robot must learn the best routes and after some iterations, it should find an optimal solution. Therefore, it was used the Q-Learning theory.
